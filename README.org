* My Telegram Bot

  A repository containing the bots developed in Scala.

** Installation

   Details regarding the installation and run of the bots

*** Prerequisites

    Download the Data. Ask benkio: [[https://benkio.github.io][benkio.github.io]]

**** Software
    - [[https://git-scm.com/][git]]
    - [[https://www.scala-sbt.org/][sbt - Scala Build Tool]]
    - [[https://www.scala-lang.org/][scala]]

*** Installation

**** Clone the Repository

#+begin_src bash
  git clone git@github.com:benkio/myTelegramBot.git
#+end_src

**** Move the Data into Resources Directory

     Earch bot contains a ~resources~ folder. You need to
     uncompress/move the data and put the files in each of the bot's
     resource folders. Put particular attention to the ~.token~ file
     contanining the telegram key specific to each bot.

     For the Richard Benson's bot it supports a postgres Database! So
     you need to provide the credentials for the database into the
     ~application.conf~ or just setup the specific environment
     variables.

     Read the following section to know how to setup the database

***** Database Setup

     There's a module called ~botDB~, if opportunately configurade,
     when launched it applies the migrations and the populate a bot
     database (Richard's one for now). Just setup the
     ~application.conf~ correctly with the DB credentials and the
     location of the files (tipically the resources of the previous
     section)

     An place where you can store your database for free is [[https://data.heroku.com/][heroku data]].

**** Compile and Test

     Just run the following commands in a shell, at the bot folder
     level, to check if everything is fine.

#+begin_src bash
  sbt compile
  sbt test:compile
  sbt fix
  sbt test
  sbt IntegrationTest/test
#+end_src

*** Run the Bots

**** Long Polling
       Under windows use the git bash terminal.

   #+begin_src bash
     ./lunch.sh # I know it's lunch not launch :)
   #+end_src

**** Webhook

***** Localhost

     - Export the webhook host, locally using [[https://ngrok.com/][ngrok]], [[https://github.com/beyondcode/expose][expose]] or [[https://github.com/agrinman/tunnelto][tunnelTo]]. example: ~./expose share http://localhost:8080~
     - Change the entry ~WEBHOOK_HOST_URL~ with the name of the host from previous step or change it in ~~myTelegramBot/main/src/main/resources/application.conf~
     - run ~sbt assembly~
     - run ~java -cp main/target/scala-2.13/main.jar com.benkio.main.MainWebhook~

***** Docker

      TODO: There's already a ~main/Dockerfile~ with the command to run the webhook, but still it needs to be tested and visible from outside
            Also check [[https://expose.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#as-a-docker-container][expose on docker]]. In order to may make it discoverable from telegram api.

*** Deploy on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure VM

**** Setup

 - Create a vm instance in Oracle cloud
 - Get the SSH Private and Public Keys to access it
 - Login to ssh vm instace by ssh private key, user and ip. get the last two in the site. Eg command: ~ssh -i <<private key of the vm>> <<user of the vm>>@<<public ip of the vm>>~ (~ssh -i ssh-key-2022-04-26.key opc@140.238.155.16~)
 - Install the jdk 16. Follow this [[https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/post/how-to-install-oracle-java-in-oracle-cloud-infrastructure][tutorial]]
**** Deploy

 - Run ~sbt "clean; main/assembly"~ to create the fat jar
 - Move the fat jar to the vm by ~rsync~ and ~ssh~. Eg. ~rsync -P -e "ssh -i <<private key of the vm>>" <<path to the fat jar -> myTelegramBot/main/target/scala-2.13/main.jar>> <<user of the vm>>@<<public ip of the vm>>:/home/<<user of the vm>>/main.jar~ (~rsync -P -e "ssh -i ssh-key-2022-04-26.key" /home/benkio/workspace/mytelegrambot/main/target/scala-2.13/main.jar opc@140.238.155.16:/home/opc/main.jar~)
 - Login to the vm
 - Be sure to have the right environment variables. IT'S RECOMMENDED TO
   CHANGE the ~application.conf~ before running the ~assembly~. The environment variables could lose their value somehow.
 - Run the bots. Easier by polling: ~java -Xmx1024m -cp main.jar com.benkio.main.MainPolling~
 - press ~Ctrl+Z~, run ~bg~ and ~disown~ in order to let previous command run in background
 - close your terminal and enjoy
