#+end_src

Simple typescript program that checks the source files for the bots (usually stored in the Dropbox folder) and checks for:
- The expected id3 tags for mp3 files and fix the artist in case.
- The expected tracks (Video and Audio) for video files
- The expected tracks (Video only) for gif files
- File Naming Consistency
