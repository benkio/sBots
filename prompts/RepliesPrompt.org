# Context
In each bot resource folder there is a <<botprefix>>_replies.json

It contains the mapping between the files the bot will reply in the
telegram chat and the triggers that will fire the reply with one of
the random files in the list.

The hard constraint is that there shouldn't be clashes between
triggers: when, given an input, you can have 2 triggers firing.
You can still have case where you have more specific triggers that
shadows more generic ones.

# Goal

In the <<botprefix>>_replies.json there are entries with no triggers
set.

Your task is to go into the files and provide the right trigger for
the entries that has only empty string (placeholder). To do so, use
the transcript of the files I provide below, extract the keywords in
there. Use them as triggers. You can use regexp as well if you see
them fit.

If necessary, add the files in other triggers if they are relevant for
the specific trigger

veramente terrificanti, terrificanti! Musicisti da guerra. Dove le stesure ritmiche, dispare, composte, stacchi all'unisono, armonie, melodie, assoli, mezzi scritti, improvvisati, con linee, stacchi di sestine, quartine, poliritmia, suddivisioni, complete... Giocare con la musica, quando ce l'hai in mano, ce giochi. Fa parte di te, ce scherzi pure sopra, te diverti.
